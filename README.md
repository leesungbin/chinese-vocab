## Data Source

The application fetches vocabulary data from a Google Sheets document. The expected data format includes:
- **Chinese**: Chinese characters
- **Pinyin**: Pronunciation guide
- **Korean**: Korean meaning/translation
- **Day**: Day group number for filtering (optional)
- **Total**: Study frequency tracking (optional)

To use your own vocabulary data:
1. Create a Google Sheets document with the required columns
2. Make the sheet publicly accessible
3. Update the `spreadsheetId` in the `fetchVocabularyData` function in `chinese-vocab-practice.tsx`

## Development

## Packages

### Frontend (`packages/frontend`)
Next.js application with vocabulary practice features including:
